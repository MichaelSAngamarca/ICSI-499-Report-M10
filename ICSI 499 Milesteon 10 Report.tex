The motivation behind Talk Assist was to develop a tool that people with life-altering visual disabilities might utilize to live their lives on an equal footing with people without them. We aim to sustain this purpose and produce a product that satisfies these great expectations placed upon us by our sponsors and the University at Albany.

\noindent
Talk Assist is an artificial intelligent voice assistant designed for individuals with visual disabilities. The project's objective is to create, test, and assess an AI-driven voice assistant that supports visually impaired users in managing daily life. Talk Assist includes two unique modes that allow users to dynamically transition based on Internet connectivity. Users can request online searches, weather, time, date information, and reminders in Online Mode. In Offline Mode, Talk Assist preserves the same weather, time, date, and reminder functionality, while also offering a calculation utility for basic computations. Talk Assist aims to simplify daily tasks for visually impaired users without the need for expensive or inaccessible healthcare technologies.
