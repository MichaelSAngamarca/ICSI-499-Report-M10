The motivation behind Talk Assist was to develop a tool that people with life-altering visual disabilities might utilize to live their lives on an equal footing with people without them. We aim to sustain this purpose and produce a product that satisfies these great expectations placed upon us by our sponsors and the University at Albany.

\noindent
Talk Assist is an artificial intelligent voice assistant designed for individuals with visual disabilities. The project's objective is to create, test, and assess an AI-driven voice assistant that supports visually impaired users in managing daily life. Talk Assist includes two unique modes that allow users to dynamically transition based on Internet connectivity. Users can request online searches, weather, time, date information, and reminders in Online Mode. In Offline Mode, Talk Assist preserves the same weather, time, date, and reminder functionality, while also offering a calculation utility for basic computations. Talk Assist aims to simplify daily tasks for visually impaired users without the need for expensive or inaccessible healthcare technologies.

\section{Problem Analysis}

\subsection{Project Statement}
Individuals with visual impairments often face significant challenges when interacting with everyday technology. Tasks such as reading screens, managing schedules, accessing online information, or performing basic device operations can require specialized tools or expensive accessibility technologies. Many existing solutions lack adaptability, rely heavily on constant internet connectivity, or are too complex for seamless daily use.

TalkAssist aims to address these challenges by providing an intuitive, AI powered voice assistant specifically designed for users with limited or no vision. The goal of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate a system that supports both online and offline functionality, delivers accurate voice feedback, and simplifies daily tasks through natural speech interaction. By integrating reliable recognition, high quality text-to-speech components, and an interface tailored for accessibility, TalkAssist seeks to make digital interaction more equitable and practical for visually impaired individuals.

\subsection{What are Existing Solutions?}
Several solutions exist in the accessibility and voice-assistant space, such as Apple’s VoiceOver, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa. While powerful, these tools are developed for broad consumer audiences rather than tailored explicitly for visually impaired users. As a result, they often require complex setups, consistent cloud connectivity, or rely on visual interfaces not optimized for non-sighted users.

Some standalone accessibility devices provide improved usability such as scre, but they can be costly and inaccessible to many. These systems also frequently depend on external hardware or lack offline capability, making them unreliable in environments with unstable internet connections.

Additionally, visually impaired users report issues such as inconsistent voice feedback, poor environmental adaptability, and difficulty performing basic tasks when offline. Users often struggle to transition smoothly between connected and disconnected settings, resulting in a fragmented user experience.

\subsection{Our Solution}
TalkAssist provides a unified, accessibility focused platform designed to meet the needs of visually impaired users in both online and offline contexts. Our system introduces the following key features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dual-Mode Functionality:} Users can operate TalkAssist in Online Mode for tasks such as web searches, weather updates, and general questions, while Offline Mode preserves essential functions like time, date, reminders, and basic calculations.
    
    \item \textbf{Accessible Voice Interaction:} The system is designed around natural speech input and clear spoken output, minimizing dependence on visual cues or screen navigation.
    
    \item \textbf{Task Management and Reminders:} Users can create, update, and manage reminders through simple voice commands in both online and offline modes, supporting daily independence.
    
    \item \textbf{Lightweight and Low-Cost Design:} Unlike expensive commercial assistive devices, TalkAssist runs on standard consumer hardware, making it affordable and widely accessible.
\end{itemize}

Together, these features create a streamlined accessibility tool that empowers visually impaired individuals to manage tasks, retrieve information, and interact with technology more independently and confidently.
